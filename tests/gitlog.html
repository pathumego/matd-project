<li> <div class=b>Fri Mar 25 02:10:12 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Many many small but crucial adjustments, normalising contrast and weight, a new g,k and some tests with kerning </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Mar 24 20:18:51 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Backing up before diving into a full review pass </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Mar 24 17:05:36 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Added diacritics! and some anchors. Anchors need some love and care. But Victor re assured my design and weight is working pretty well. I will fix the basic diacritics before doing anything else on this file. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Mar 24 17:03:49 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Had a feedback session with Victor. The weight inconsistencies are the highlight of the evening :P I have to take a careful pass over the whole thing and fix the problems. My make fast break fast is a bit too fast now I think. e,a,d bowls specifically. And g,k need more love. Exit strokes of l,i,n,h needs to be thinner, said Victor, but Im not sure weather I want to reduce the spottiness of the whole thing. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Wed Mar 23 22:42:11 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor fixes and clean up to the files </li>
<li> <div class=b>Wed Mar 23 22:41:55 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Haha sit-down with Fiona, finally the Ka, Na, Ta problem is nearing a solution. Expanded and added a few more characters. Overall proportions are fixed in this commit. I am going to stick with this contrast for now, Maybe later I will start adding more contrast </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 20:28:01 2016 +0000</div> <br /> minor fixes and small adjustments, new /A looks good now. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 20:27:28 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Hell Yeah! ta, na sa and ka is sorted for now. I nailed the relationship and proportions. Draft of Da need a lot of work </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 14:54:01 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Adding new inclined Tamil and micro updates. I like the inclined tamil </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 14:53:08 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Cleanup to Adobe Latin 1 </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 01:36:21 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Some fixes ti the inconsistencies </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 01:35:52 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Normalising things and small fixes to stems </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 01:14:19 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor Updates to test </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 22 00:05:51 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok Im going to give pass through all the files and normalise. All in all its ok now. But the bold weight is here and there. This commit fixes a few, but I will work more on it. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sun Mar 20 23:40:58 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Some minor updates. Still not happy with how Sinhala looks. Sadly the more regular proportions that I was trying was looking odd. With the time frame I don't think I can experiment with the proportions. So sticking to model from 1890's Wesleyan mission press types for now and see how it goes. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sun Mar 20 23:11:50 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Hell yeah, I like where this is going. An upright tamil with a touch of slanted features. Ill let it be for now. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Mar 19 22:15:18 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Quick and dirty numerals for testing, i don't like this at all, just playing around with ideas </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Mar 19 11:13:54 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Quck and dirty Bold uppercase for testing samples </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Mar 19 11:00:43 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Few ideas for a new italic a bit friendly rounded </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Mar 19 11:00:23 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Lot of normalisation, shooting out. Now this is ok, but very unwelcoming to read, when longer text is set it is not very pleasant to read, but In-between words and small paragraphs in roman text looks good. I will hold this for now </li>
<li> <div class=b>Wed Mar 16 22:50:37 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Bold uppercase weight trials, have to decide later </li>
<li> <div class=b>Wed Mar 16 22:30:32 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Complete lowercase draft, improvements to many glyphs and normalising. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 15 18:22:30 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Micro fixes, new glyphs additions, small improvements, normalising the features like serifs on all files. Micro level. After this Im starting a systematic development process. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Mar 15 18:20:06 2016 +0000</div> <br /> A new sinhala based on the inclined version </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Feb 27 11:27:32 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor updates and additions few new experiments </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Feb 27 11:26:28 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Gerad week is over, one of the best weeks ever. I was in a trans kind of situation. Without knowing where exactly I'm going. Just kept developing things fast and smooth. Make fast-break fast week. Now i have to sit down and organise my work and see what i can develop further. The optional roman can be become a title or display face. It looks nice, but in text sizes a bit too rigid to the eye. Anyway my brief was vauge enough to play around. Just newspapers. So I think I will detail the brief later on with more specifics of the genre of the newspaper and style. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Fri Feb 26 14:34:07 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Cleanup and organisation </li>
<li> <div class=b>Fri Feb 26 14:10:11 2016 +0000</div> <br /> ok looking good, I'm going to show this to grad in a bit and get more feedback, but I fixed some spacing, normalised stuff </li>
<li> <div class=b>Fri Feb 26 14:08:34 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Finally a working f and things i like, fixed a few spacing and touch ups here and there based on heads feedback </li>
<li> <div class=b>Fri Feb 26 14:07:51 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Major update with many glyphs. I now see what Gerad said about the bold weight. Its very hard to keep the feel i want and expand and add weight. Nice challenge. Im gonna keep working on this for a bit too </li>
<li> <div class=b>Fri Feb 26 14:06:37 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Im not sure what changes i did but this is just not going to be further developed </li>
<li> <div class=b>Fri Feb 26 14:06:03 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Major updates and new glyphs with feedback from Gerad. basic glyphs only. No uppercase. But Now i like this, not very boring, but a bit boring, so I have to make it a bit more fun, but that till later time </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 25 17:08:17 2016 +0000</div> <br /> I like this a lot, but its more of a semi bold right now, so ill work on making it more bold and wide </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 25 16:16:56 2016 +0000</div> <br /> OK backing up my crazy new version </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 25 13:33:11 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok this is good, I'm going to try something new </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 25 11:47:51 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok this i like, Gerad said I should consider using this as a inspiration for roman lets see how it goes. I did a sample -opt-1. Looks ok, but with the time I have i might not be able to go crazy with that model. Im going to put it on the wall on tuesday and see. It has potential, I have tis idea of using this model for my bolds :) </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 25 11:44:58 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor updates and backing up before clean up </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 25 11:44:02 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Cleanup </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 23 17:46:56 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Im starting a new version, keeping this aside for now </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 23 10:38:10 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Two options, keep working on this and make it upright and see how it goes, if I can transfer any thing from this to the roman </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 23 10:37:22 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Unger feedback: d,b narrow/ Add serif to G/ M bring the joint down/ G,O,C is rotated </li>
<li> <div class=b>Mon Feb 22 15:01:21 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Italic madness. I did three versions to see how it all work out. Im happy with the Italic 2 Now i have a hang of how this works. SO Im gonna just work on one version now. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 18 17:33:11 2016 +0000</div> <br /> more and more minor fixes </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 18 17:32:28 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok this is nice, I like this for the emphasis style. But i have to work on it more. Holding this for a while. I have to get the upright in place </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Feb 18 17:31:34 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok this is alright. Its working in smaller sizes, and better in economy. BUT I feel it lacks a soul, too mechanical. So I'm going to start from the scratch </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 16 01:33:46 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Cleaning up latin files </li>
<li> <div class=b>Mon Feb 15 22:51:31 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor Updates to test </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sun Feb 14 16:13:10 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Fix </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sun Feb 14 16:12:01 2016 +0000</div> <br /> ha ha a few final fixes </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sun Feb 14 15:56:34 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok, i completed uppercase for testing. Most characters are just drafts, to test out ideas. And see the setting of the tex. Spacing is mostly shit. But Now i can set real text and test. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sun Feb 14 15:51:03 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor updates </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sun Feb 14 15:50:51 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Completed draft uppercase </li>
<li> <div class=b>Fri Feb 5 11:44:07 2016 +0000</div> <br /> ok this italics are not really good, i have basic idea of whats happening is there. im going to work on a new edition </li>
<li> <div class=b>Wed Feb 3 23:01:46 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok its not working, ill start something new tomorrow </li>
<li> <div class=b>Wed Feb 3 23:01:16 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Some updates and this survive is looking good, it is just a mall experiment with a weird modulation. But I think its working. </li>
<li> <div class=b>Wed Feb 3 23:00:04 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Fixed some smmal stuff </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 2 16:03:41 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Ok italic is noce so im moving foreward with developing the idea of a. Stroke swelling in the bods, heavy in top and bottom </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 2 16:00:57 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Gerry: Baseline adjustmens, h too heavy, r is out of place, C could use some love, altoghter its all good. Im gnna work on Italics now </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 2 15:34:43 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor Updates to test </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Feb 2 01:25:13 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Fixed most of the spacing issues getting ready for tomorrow </li>
<li> <div class=b>Mon Feb 1 18:48:07 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Update before starting proper spacing, y is still shitty </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Jan 30 20:01:27 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Some drafts, maybe too much </li>
<li> <div class=b>Sat Jan 30 20:00:24 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Added more glyphs and backing up before streamilining the weight </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Jan 28 17:54:52 2016 +0000</div> <br /> ok I got feedback from Fiona, so backing up before more changes </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Jan 28 17:54:24 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Im board, so starting with italics for a change </li>
<li> <div class=b>Thu Jan 28 17:53:54 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Looking good, adding a few more letters and caps </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Jan 26 15:54:12 2016 +0000</div> <br /> So this is good, but I'm going to make it lighter and consistent with stroke behaviour </li>
<li> <div class=b>Tue Jan 26 00:32:30 2016 +0000</div> <br /> Minor Updates to test </li>
