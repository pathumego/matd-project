== Project Overview
This project will focus on developing a typeface family for present day web & print newspapers with complex typographic layouts which require typographers to set content with different lengths into a predetermined space. The type family will contain a set of fonts with different overall widths but have the same appearance and color as the primary face. The project is not explicitly targeted towards a medium such as web or print. The character set will support Latin extended, Thaana and Sinhala languages.

== Background
Newspapers, both web and print can be considered as one of the most challenging and complicated pieces of typographic design. Newspapers require the building of a clear typographic hierarchy in a strict space structure and make sure that typographic arrangement does not interfere with the meaning of the text. When setting sensitive pieces of news in a strict space it is important to maintain a clear differentiation. In a single page of a newspaper we can observe a range of typographic elements such as titles, subtitles, pull quotes and meta information. Making the task more complicated, typographers have to fit in as much as possible text into a page without compromising any of the above mentioned aspects. Typographers use of type families with a range of styles to build aforementioned complex structures. Recent projects like Guardian Egyptian is an example where type designers were asked 'to draw as wide a range of weights as possible'.^1^

In the age of web newspapers, the typographers are facing the same challenges in a different context. More medium specific information elements and interactive elements such as hyperlinks and audiovisual content have become an integral part of a web newspaper. This interactivity and the dynamic nature of the web poses new possibilities and challenges to designers. A typographer designing for the web has to think about their design as a system that would adapt to different sizes than a static design. Since the start of digital type the type size has been an abstract metaphor that is realised only once a design is printed. But in web publishing the typographer has completely lost control over the size of the type. On the web, the size is a more abstract formula that is defined by the relationship between screen size, design elements, typographic elements and user preference.

This project is focusing on space economy related to newspaper design. It is a common concern for newspapers published in any language and often for Indic scripts with wider letterforms this is crucial.

== Specific concerns in Thaana script
Thaana script is used to write Divehi, the native language of Maldives. The script is used by around two hundred and seventy thousand people living in the Republic of Maldives a set of islands southwest of India. Thaana is a vocalized abjad and written and read from right to left. The Thaana script has 24 consonants (Akuru), a null consonant (Alifu) and 10 vowel marks (Fili). Fili’s are added to above or below the base consonant to make it a syllable. Thaana uses Arabic numerals. Arabic characters such as XX are commonly used Thaana texts.

Maldives had at least two more distinctive writing systems prior to Thaana, Eveyla Akuru and Dhives / Divehi Akuru both of them were left-to-right scripts. Thaana script was developed in 18th century to meet the needs of the Dhivehi language by the scholars who were fluent in both Arabic and Divehi Akuru. It shared many characteristics of Arabic scripts since the alphabet has derived from Arabic and ancient Divehi Akuru. Some of the characteristics of Arabic writing had been modified in connection with Divehi Akuru early in the development of the script and overtime the relationship to Arabic has faded.^2^ ^3^
