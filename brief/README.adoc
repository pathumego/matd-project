== Abstract
This project will focus on developing a typeface family for present day web & print newspapers with complex typographic layouts. These layouts require typographers to set content of varying lengths into a predetermined space.

== Introduction
The type family will contain a set of fonts with different overall widths but will maintain the same appearance and color as the primary face. The project is not explicitly targeted towards a specific medium such as web or print. The character set will support Latin extended, Thaana, and Sinhala languages.

== Background
Newspapers, both web and print, are considered some of the most challenging and complicated pieces of typographic design. They require a clear typographic hierarchy within a strict space structure and ensure that the typographic arrangement does not interfere with the meaning of the text. Recent projects like Guardian Egyptian exemplify the demand for a wide range of weights in type design.

== Specific Concerns in Thaana Script
Thaana script is used to write Divehi, the native language of the Maldives. It is a vocalized abjad and written from right to left. The script includes 24 consonants and 10 vowel marks. Modifications to the script over time have introduced characters such as Tikijehi Thaana to accommodate additional sounds.

== Thaana Typography in Modern Times
The Thaana script has evolved to have a more monolinear stroke behavior. Current typographic forms are structured and linear, requiring high line heights to maintain legibility due to identical forms of above and below base marks.

== Specific Concerns in Sinhala Script
Sinhala script is predominantly used in Sri Lanka and has evolved from early Brahmic forms to more circular and complex letterforms. The script requires ample spacing for a comfortable reading experience, often leading to increased leading and tracking.

== Conclusion
This project aims to create a typeface family that addresses the specific needs of newspaper design in Thaana and Sinhala scripts, providing solutions that enhance space economy and readability.
